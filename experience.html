			<h4>COOPFARMASI Kuala Terengganu.</h4><br>
			<p style="background-color: lightblue; text-align: justify; font-family: Times New Roman;">I worked as a pharmacy helper during the COVID era. It was very busy because there were so many covid cases at the time. I had to be extra careful and take extra care of myself because I needed to be healthy before I could serve the customers. It was fun because I needed to learn about and remember all the different kinds of sickness and medicine. So far, I've been fortunate enough to avoid contracting any illnesses while working here, particularly COVID-19. There have been more instances of me being in close contact than I can keep track of. It is impossible to predict what the future holds, even though we have adhered to all government-mandated standard operating procedure manuals.</p>

    		<h4>March 2021 - March 2022 (1 year).</h4>
    		<h4>Ar-Rahnu Kokemas Kuala Terengganu.</h4><br>
    		<p style="background-color: lightblue;text-align: center; font-family: Times New Roman;">As I work at Ar-Rahnu, I am looking into my experience and connecting with others. I have been promoted to office assistant.  I have to take care of a lot of things because I am new and do not have much experience or information. Everything I learned here was interesting because I learned so much about the quality of gold. As a young person, I do not usually take part in knowing this. In fact, I am working here to pass the time before I go further my studies, but I also chose to do it for my resume and experience. It is a blessing that I was hired for this job because it is only open to people older than me with experience.</p>
